# Week 5: These are testing times!

It's time to talk about testing. 

It's time to ensure that all your units (routes/web pages, models, and any
additional Ruby methods - sometimes called library methods - you may have
written) are being tested. 

Start to think about your end to end tests. Choose end to end tests that satisfy
your user stories (acceptance tests) and other paths through the system that
check it behaves correctly as well as not behaving incorrectly. 

_Don't_ make one person in your team do all the testing. That's just lazy group
organisation. Developers should write unit tests for the code they're writing,
and you should all contribute to the end to end tests to ensure a good level of
overall coverage. It's a good idea to have someone who is in charge of ensuring
tests are being written and that they're of good quality.
