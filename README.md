## 2. Getting Started

Before you start with anything, you need to get Codio setup so that you can  run the examples in this repository, and eventually, develop your team project. To do this, follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](./getting-started/README.md) page.

If you **encounter technical problems or issues**, you'll need to consult the [Technical FAQ](technical-FAQ.md). Importantly, this page tells you what to do if your particular question or issue is not specifically addressed by the FAQ itself. 

The [Group Project Brief](Spring-Project-Brief.md) will give necessary details about your group project and assessments. If you have any questions regarding that, please consult the [Project FAQ](https://github.com/UoS-COM1001/com1001-2024/blob/main/project-FAQ.md) and use the Discussion Board/Forum. 

## 3. Schedule and Resources

Materials for the module can all be found in this repository, which consists of directories corresponding to content for each week. Files will be added as we proceed through the module, so ensure that you regularly do a `git pull`.

### Lectures

Lectures will be held on **Tuesday mornings 9am-12noon (week 1) / 10am-12 noon (weeks 2-6) in St George's Church**. There will be a break during the 2 hour lecture, and also a (non-assessed) team quiz. There will be a prize in week 6 for the team that performs best overall in the quizzes. 

### Practical Sessions (Labs)

Practical sessions will be held on **Fridays 1-2pm in the [Diamond](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/floor-plans) from week 1 until week 10** (but excluding week 7). The practical sessions consist of team exercises, coding challenges, and will offer practical technical help regarding the team project. You will need to bring your own laptop to this session, or use the laptop loan facility.

Where you go and where you sit depends on which team you're in:

* **Teams 1-26** need to go to **Computer Room 3** on the second floor, and follow the [seating plan for CR3](misc/CR3-seating-plan.pdf).
* **Teams 27-53** need to go to **Computer Room 5** (formerly known as the Mindsphere lounge) on the ground floor, and follow the [seating plan for CR5](misc/CR5-seating-plan.pdf).

### Supervisor Meetings

Each team will be allocated a supervisor (a member of the department's teaching staff). Each team will meet with their supervisor once a week, **starting in week 2 and finishing in week 11**. These meetings will happen on **Tuesday afternoons between 1-3pm in Computer Room 5** (formerly known as the Mindsphere lounge) on the ground floor of the Diamond. You only need to attend a 15-minute meeting in this two-hour block. The exact time of your team meetings and the seating plan is available [here](misc/CR5-seating-plan-supervisor-meeting.pdf). 

There are two types of meetings – "Catch-up" and "Demo". During **"Catch-up" meetings**, supervisors will discuss with you how your project is going and check that all your team members are engaged with it. **Demo** meetings are where you will demonstrate your work to your supervisor. These meetings will happen in the week prior to handing in your work for Iterations 1 and 2. For the demo, your team will need its own device to showcase your work – or, you can use the laptop loan facility.

Note: your team supervisor will focus on monitoring your progress and teamwork, *not* providing technical advice on your project.
