# Week 2 Challenges

1. Extend [`times_table_with_params_example`](../week1/times_table_with_params_example) demonstrated in lectures in week 1 by adding a form to send the values of `m` and `l`, so that the user has a user interface rather than having to change the query part of the URL.

2. Extend [`sanitisation_validation_example`](./sanitisation_validation_example) presented in this week's lecture:

  * Add a new field for the person's salutation ("Mr", "Mrs", "Miss", "Prof." etc.), as a drop-down list.
  
  * Add a checkbox, recording if the person would like to recieve further contact via their email address.
