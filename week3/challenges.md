# Week 3 Challenges

1. Change the [`football_players_example`](../week3/football_players_example) demonstrated in lectures in week 3 to search for clubs so that the query works in a case-insensitive manner (currently it is case sensitive).

2. Change the [`football_players_example`](../week3/football_players_example) so that it searches for clubs that *don't* have the text entered into the search box. So if the user entered "United", it would show all clubs without "United" in the name. In other words, the search query is negated. 

3. Change the [`football_players_example`](../week3/football_players_example) so that the field is to search for a player's name. Note though, that a player's name is in two fields in the database. A player needs to be in the search results matches their firstname OR their surname.
